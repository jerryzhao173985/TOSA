## Introduction

This comprehensive research document explores the Tensor Operator Set Architecture (TOSA) in ARM, covering its architecture, integration with machine learning frameworks, implementation in various neural network architectures, applications to advanced models, optimization techniques with code examples, and career guidance for professionals interested in this field.

TOSA has emerged as a critical technology in the machine learning ecosystem, particularly for deploying AI models on ARM-based edge devices. As the demand for on-device AI continues to grow, understanding TOSA and its implementation on ARM hardware becomes increasingly important for developers, researchers, and organizations looking to leverage the power of machine learning in resource-constrained environments.

This research aims to provide a thorough understanding of TOSA in ARM, from its fundamental architecture to practical implementation details, with a focus on real-world applications and career opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

## TOSA Architecture Overview

TOSA (Tensor Operator Set Architecture) provides a standardized set of whole-tensor operations designed to enable consistent execution of machine learning workloads across diverse hardware platforms. It serves as an intermediate representation between high-level ML frameworks and hardware implementations.

### Key Characteristics

- **Standardized Tensor Operations**: TOSA provides a minimal yet stable set of tensor-level operators that act as a common intermediate representation.
- **Hardware and Software Independence**: Designed to enable consistent execution across diverse processors including ARM's SIMD CPUs, Mali GPUs, and NPUs.
- **Comprehensive Support**: Defines whole-tensor operations fundamental to deep neural networks.
- **Flexible Data Types**: Supports both quantized integer and floating-point content.
- **Precise Specifications**: Includes precise functional and numerical descriptions for each operator.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Not tied to any specific ML framework, allowing for broad compatibility.

### Why TOSA Was Created

The creation of TOSA was motivated by several challenges in the machine learning ecosystem:

1. **Rapid Framework Evolution**: ML frameworks are evolving rapidly, making it difficult to maintain compatibility.
2. **Fragmented Ecosystem**: Hardware and software inference platforms are fragmented, requiring significant effort to optimize for different targets.
3. **Optimization Overhead**: Significant work is required to optimize networks for different platforms.
4. **Lack of Standards**: No standards existed for numerical behavior (e.g., quantization) and functionality.
5. **Proliferation of ML Hardware**: ML acceleration is appearing on more devices, creating a need for standardization.

TOSA addresses these challenges by providing a stable intermediate representation that can be targeted by high-level frameworks and implemented efficiently on diverse hardware platforms, particularly ARM-based systems.

## ML Frameworks Integration

TOSA serves as a bridge between high-level ML frameworks and hardware implementations. This section explores how TOSA integrates with major ML frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX.

### PyTorch Integration

ARM has collaborated with Meta to introduce support for ARM platforms in ExecuTorch, enabling PyTorch models to run efficiently on ARM hardware using TOSA as an intermediate representation.

#### Integration Flow

1. PyTorch model → quantized TOSA representation (using PyTorch's dynamo export flow)
2. TOSA graph → ARM Ethos-U compiler (Vela) with TOSA front-end
3. Vela generates optimized machine instructions (command stream)
4. Execution on Ethos-U family of NPUs (U55, U65, U85)

#### Implementation Details

- ExecuTorch provides an API for partial delegation of graphs
- TOSA-compliant quantization is supported
- The flow works for standard networks and custom `torch.nn.Module` implementations
- Example models include SoftmaxModule, AddModule, and MobileNetV2

#### Code Example

```python
# Import necessary modules
from executorch.backends.arm.arm_backend import (
    ArmCompileSpecBuilder,
    get_tosa_spec,
)
from executorch.exir import to_edge
from executorch.exir import ExecutorchBackendConfig

# Create ARM compile specs with TOSA backend
arm_compile_spec_builder = ArmCompileSpecBuilder()
tosa_spec = get_tosa_spec(arm_compile_spec_builder.get_specs())

# Export the model with TOSA backend
exported_program = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs)
edge_program = to_edge(exported_program)
edge_program.to_executorch(
    ExecutorchBackendConfig(
        "arm",
        compile_specs=[tosa_spec],
    )
)
```

#### GitHub Repositories

PyTorch has two paths to TOSA:
1. Via torch-mlir project: https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/tree/main/lib/Conversion/TorchToTosa
2. Via ExecuTorch: https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/backends/arm

### TensorFlow Integration

TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite can be lowered to TOSA for efficient execution on ARM hardware.

#### Integration Flow

- TensorFlow operators are lowered to TOSA via the MLIR compiler infrastructure
- ARM NN SDK enables execution of TensorFlow Lite models on ARM CPUs and Mali GPUs
- ARM NN includes a TOSA reference implementation (TosaRef)

#### Implementation Details

- The tosa-checker tool verifies model compatibility with TOSA
- TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers demonstrates deployment on ARM Cortex-M devices

#### GitHub Repositories

- TensorFlow to TOSA mapping: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tosa/transforms
  - Mainly in legalize_tf.cc, legalize_common.cc, legalize_tfl.cc

### ONNX Integration

ONNX models can be converted to TOSA for execution on ARM hardware through multiple pathways.

#### Integration Flow

- ONNX Runtime provides an ARM NN Execution Provider
- MLIR compiler infrastructure is used to develop legalization passes that translate ONNX graphs to TOSA

#### Implementation Options

1. Direct ONNX to TOSA conversion via onnx-mlir: https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir/tree/main/src/Conversion/ONNXToTOSA
2. Indirect conversion: ONNX → torch-mlir → TOSA

#### Common Integration Patterns

Across all three frameworks, several common patterns emerge:

1. **Lowering Process**: High-level operators are mapped to TOSA primitives through compiler infrastructure (typically MLIR)
2. **Quantization Support**: TOSA provides standardized quantization across frameworks
3. **Hardware Targets**: Primary targets are ARM CPUs, Mali GPUs, and Ethos NPUs
4. **Deployment Flow**: Framework → TOSA → Hardware-specific compiler → Execution

## Neural Network Implementations

This section explores how different neural network architectures are implemented using TOSA on ARM platforms, focusing on CNNs, RNNs, and Transformer networks.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

ARM has successfully implemented MobileNetV2, a popular CNN architecture, using TOSA as an intermediate representation. This implementation demonstrates the feasibility of running quantized PyTorch models on TOSA-compliant hardware.

#### Implementation Flow

1. PyTorch model → quantized TOSA representation (using PyTorch's dynamo export flow)
2. TOSA graph → ARM Ethos-U compiler (Vela) with TOSA front-end
3. Vela generates optimized machine instructions (command stream)
4. Execution on Ethos-U family of NPUs (U55, U65, U85)

#### Key Features

- Support for both floating-point and quantized integer operations
- Efficient mapping of CNN operations to TOSA primitives
- Optimization for memory bandwidth and compute efficiency
- CNNs are typically compute-bound, requiring specific optimizations

#### Code Example (PyTorch to TOSA)

```python
# Example from ExecuTorch ARM backend
from executorch.backends.arm.arm_backend import (
    ArmCompileSpecBuilder,
    get_tosa_spec,
    is_ethosu,
    is_tosa,
)
from executorch.backends.arm.quantizer.arm_quantizer import (
    EthosUQuantizer,
    get_symmetric_quantization_config,
    TOSAQuantizer,
)

# Create a MobileNetV2 model
model = MobileNetV2()

# Quantize the model
quantizer = None
if is_ethosu(compile_specs):
    quantizer = EthosUQuantizer(compile_specs)
elif is_tosa(compile_specs):
    quantizer = TOSAQuantizer(get_tosa_spec(compile_specs))

# Set quantization configuration
operator_config = get_symmetric_quantization_config(is_per_channel=False)
quantizer.set_global(operator_config)

# Prepare and convert model
m = prepare_pt2e(model, quantizer)
# Run calibration data through the model
for sample in calibration_data:
    m(sample)
m = convert_pt2e(m)

# Export to TOSA representation
# This happens internally in the ARM backend
```

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

RNNs require special handling to be compatible with TOSA and ARM Ethos-U hardware. The key technique is "unrolling" the recurrent structure to create a feedforward network that can be efficiently mapped to TOSA operators.

#### Implementation Flow

1. Define RNN model in TensorFlow (GRU or LSTM)
2. Set the `unroll=True` parameter to remove loops
3. Quantize the model to 8-bit precision
4. Convert to TensorFlow Lite format
5. Compile with Vela for Ethos-U hardware

#### Key Features

- Unrolling transforms recurrent loops into a series of feedforward operations
- Fixed number of time steps must be known in advance
- Supports both GRU and LSTM variants
- Enables efficient execution on ARM Ethos-U NPUs

#### Code Example (TensorFlow RNN Unrolling)

```python
# Define a deployment-ready GRU model with unrolling
def create_gru_model(time_steps, features):
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(time_steps, features), batch_size=1)
    # Set unroll=True to remove the loop and create a feedforward network
    gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(
        units=32,
        activation='tanh',
        recurrent_activation='sigmoid',
        unroll=True,
        return_sequences=False
    )(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(gru)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

# Create model and load weights
model = create_gru_model(time_steps=28, features=28)
model.load_weights('gru_weights.h5')

# Quantize the model
def representative_dataset():
    for i in range(100):
        yield [np.random.randn(1, 28, 28).astype(np.float32)]

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.representative_dataset = representative_dataset
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.int8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.int8
tflite_model = converter.convert()
```

### Transformer Networks

ARM's Ethos-U85 NPU is specifically designed to support Transformer networks at the edge, with TOSA compatibility. This enables efficient execution of attention-based models on ARM hardware.

#### Key Features

- Ethos-U85 scales from 128 to 2048 MAC units
- Designed to run in both Cortex-M and Cortex-A based systems
- 20% more energy-efficient than previous generations
- Specifically optimized for Transformer workloads
- TOSA-compatible implementation

#### Architecture Considerations

- Transformer networks involve both compute-bound operations (attention mechanism) and memory-bound operations (fully connected layers)
- Different optimizations are needed for different parts of the network
- Attention mechanisms require efficient matrix multiplication support
- Memory bandwidth is critical for fully connected layers

#### Implementation Challenges

- Wide variety of workloads requiring different optimizations
- Multiple machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Limited power budget on edge devices
- Cost, power, performance, and area tradeoffs

### Common Implementation Patterns

Across all three neural network architectures, several common patterns emerge for TOSA implementation on ARM hardware:

1. **Quantization**: All implementations rely on quantization to 8-bit precision for efficient execution on ARM NPUs
2. **Framework Agnostic**: TOSA provides a common intermediate representation regardless of the source framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
3. **Hardware-Specific Compilation**: The Vela compiler translates TOSA representations to hardware-specific instructions
4. **Optimization Tradeoffs**: Different network architectures require different optimization strategies (compute vs. memory bandwidth)

## Applications to Advanced Models

This section explores how TOSA is applied to advanced AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models like Stable Diffusion on ARM hardware platforms.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but traditionally require powerful cloud infrastructure. TOSA plays a crucial role in enabling these models to run efficiently on ARM-based edge devices by providing a standardized set of tensor operations that can be optimized for specific hardware.

#### ExecuTorch and TOSA for LLMs

PyTorch's ExecuTorch framework leverages TOSA as one of its key backends for deploying LLMs to edge devices:

exported_program = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs)
edge_program = to_edge(exported_program)
edge_program.to_executorch(
    ExecutorchBackendConfig(
        "arm",
        compile_specs=[tosa_spec],
    )
)
```

## ARM ML Optimizations and Code Examples

This section provides a technical deep dive into ARM ML optimizations using TOSA, with specific code examples and implementation details.

### Ahead-of-Time Compilation Flow

The ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation flow converts PyTorch models to TOSA representation and then to hardware-specific instructions. Here's a detailed example from the `aot_arm_compiler.py` file:

```python
from executorch.backends.arm.arm_backend import (
    ArmCompileSpecBuilder,
    get_tosa_spec,
    is_ethosu,
    is_tosa,
)
from executorch.backends.arm.ethosu_partitioner import EthosUPartitioner
from executorch.backends.arm.quantizer.arm_quantizer import (
    EthosUQuantizer,
    get_symmetric_quantization_config,
    TOSAQuantizer,
)
from executorch.backends.arm.tosa_partitioner import TOSAPartitioner
from executorch.backends.arm.tosa_specification import TosaSpecification

# Create ARM compile specs with TOSA backend
arm_compile_spec_builder = ArmCompileSpecBuilder()
tosa_spec = get_tosa_spec(arm_compile_spec_builder.get_specs())

# Export the model with TOSA backend
exported_program = torch.export.export(model, example_inputs)
edge_program = to_edge(exported_program)
edge_program.to_executorch(
    ExecutorchBackendConfig(
        "arm",
        compile_specs=[tosa_spec],
    )
)
```

### Quantization for ARM Hardware

Quantization is crucial for efficient execution on ARM hardware. The following code demonstrates the quantization process for TOSA:

```python
def quantize(
    model: torch.nn.Module,
    model_name: str,
    compile_specs: list[CompileSpec],
    example_inputs: Tuple[torch.Tensor],
    evaluator_name: str | None,
    evaluator_config: Dict[str, Any] | None,
) -> torch.nn.Module:
    """This is the official recommended flow for quantization in pytorch 2.0 export"""
    logging.info("Quantizing Model...")
    
    # Select appropriate quantizer based on target hardware
    quantizer = None
    if is_ethosu(compile_specs):
        quantizer = EthosUQuantizer(compile_specs)
    elif is_tosa(compile_specs):
        quantizer = TOSAQuantizer(get_tosa_spec(compile_specs))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Unsupported compilespecs for quantization!")
    
    # Configure quantization parameters
    # If we set is_per_channel to True, we also need to add out_variant of 
    # quantize_per_channel/dequantize_per_channel operator
    operator_config = get_symmetric_quantization_config(is_per_channel=False)
    quantizer.set_global(operator_config)
    
    # Prepare model for quantization
    m = prepare_pt2e(model, quantizer)
    
    # Run calibration data through the model
    dataset = get_calibration_data(
        model_name, example_inputs, evaluator_name, evaluator_config
    )
    
    # The dataset could be a tuple of tensors or a DataLoader
    if isinstance(dataset, DataLoader):
        for sample, _ in dataset:
            m(sample)
    else:
        m(*dataset)
    
    # Convert model to quantized version
    m = convert_pt2e(m)
    
    return m
```

### TOSA Partitioning and Delegation

TOSA partitioning is used to identify which parts of a model can be delegated to specialized hardware:

```python
# Import TOSA partitioner
from executorch.backends.arm.tosa_partitioner import TOSAPartitioner

# Create partitioner
partitioner = TOSAPartitioner()

# Apply partitioning to the model
partitioned_model = partitioner.partition(model)
```

For Ethos-U NPUs, additional optimizations are applied:

```python
from executorch.backends.arm.ethosu_partitioner import EthosUPartitioner

# Create EthosU partitioner
partitioner = EthosUPartitioner()

# Apply partitioning to the model
partitioned_model = partitioner.partition(model)

# Compile for specific Ethos-U target
target = "ethos-u85-256"  # Options include u55/u65/u85 with different MAC configurations
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Operator Fusion

TOSA enables operator fusion, which combines multiple operations into a single optimized operation:

```python
# Example of how TOSA represents fused operations
# A Conv2d followed by BatchNorm and ReLU would be represented as:
# Conv2d -> TOSA CONV_2D
# BatchNorm -> TOSA RESCALE (parameters calculated from BatchNorm)
# ReLU -> TOSA CLAMP (with min=0, max=inf)
# 
# After fusion:
# Conv2d+BatchNorm+ReLU -> TOSA CONV_2D with integrated rescale and clamp
```

#### 2. Memory Optimization

Memory access patterns are optimized for ARM architectures:

```python
# Memory layout optimization in TOSA
# NCHW (PyTorch default) -> NHWC (ARM hardware optimized)
# This transformation happens during the lowering process
```

#### 3. Quantization-Aware Delegation

The code selectively delegates operations based on quantization support:

```python
def delegate_ops(model, compile_specs):
    """Delegate operations to hardware accelerators based on quantization support"""
    delegated_ops = []
    
    # Check if operation is supported by target hardware
    for op in model.operations:
        if is_supported_by_hardware(op, compile_specs):
            delegated_ops.append(op)
    
    return delegated_ops
```

### Complete End-to-End Example

Here's a complete example of exporting a MobileNetV2 model to run on Ethos-U85:

```python
import torch
from executorch.backends.arm.arm_backend import (
    ArmCompileSpecBuilder,
    get_tosa_spec,
)
from executorch.exir import to_edge
from executorch.exir import ExecutorchBackendConfig
from torchvision.models import mobilenet_v2

# 1. Create or load a model
model = mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True)
model.eval()
example_inputs = (torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224),)

# 2. Quantize the model
from executorch.backends.arm.quantizer.arm_quantizer import (
    TOSAQuantizer,
    get_symmetric_quantization_config,
)
from torch.ao.quantization.quantize_pt2e import prepare_pt2e, convert_pt2e

# Create ARM compile specs
arm_compile_spec_builder = ArmCompileSpecBuilder()
tosa_spec = get_tosa_spec(arm_compile_spec_builder.get_specs())

# Create quantizer
quantizer = TOSAQuantizer(tosa_spec)
operator_config = get_symmetric_quantization_config(is_per_channel=False)
quantizer.set_global(operator_config)

# Prepare model for quantization
prepared_model = prepare_pt2e(model, quantizer)

# Run calibration data
calibration_data = [(torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224),) for _ in range(100)]
for data in calibration_data:
    prepared_model(*data)

# Convert to quantized model
quantized_model = convert_pt2e(prepared_model)

# 3. Export to TOSA representation
exported_program = torch.export.export(quantized_model, example_inputs)
edge_program = to_edge(exported_program)

# 4. Compile for Ethos-U85
compiled_program = edge_program.to_executorch(
    ExecutorchBackendConfig(
        "arm",
        compile_specs=[tosa_spec],
    )
)

# 5. Save the compiled program
from executorch.extension.export_util.utils import save_pte_program
save_pte_program(compiled_program, "mobilenet_v2_ethos_u85.pte")
```

### Runtime Execution on ARM Hardware

The compiled model can be executed on ARM hardware using the ExecuTorch runtime:

```cpp
// C++ code for runtime execution
#include <executorch/runtime/executor/executor.h>
#include <executorch/runtime/platform/runtime.h>
#include <executorch/backends/arm/runtime/EthosUDelegate.h>

// Load the compiled program
et::Program program;
ET_CHECK_OK(et::Program::load("mobilenet_v2_ethos_u85.pte", &program));

// Create executor
et::Executor executor;
ET_CHECK_OK(executor.init(program));

// Register ARM delegate
EthosUDelegate delegate;
ET_CHECK_OK(executor.register_delegate("arm", &delegate));

// Prepare input tensor
et::Tensor input_tensor = /* create input tensor */;
et::Method method = executor.get_method("forward");
et::MethodMeta meta = method.get_metadata();

// Execute the model
et::EValue input(input_tensor);
et::EValue output;
ET_CHECK_OK(method({input}, {&output}));

// Process output
float* output_data = output.toTensor().data_ptr<float>();
```

### Optimization Results
