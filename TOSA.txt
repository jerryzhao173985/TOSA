Tensor Operator Set Architecture (TOSA) in Machine Learning on ARM PlatformsThe increasing demand for efficient and portable machine learning solutions, particularly in edge and embedded computing, has led to a complex landscape of diverse hardware platforms and software frameworks. Each framework, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX, offers its own set of operators for building neural networks 1. This heterogeneity creates significant challenges for developers aiming to deploy their models across a wide range of devices, especially the power-efficient and versatile ARM-based processors that are prevalent in these domains 1. The sheer number of operators, which continues to grow with the rapid evolution of machine learning, poses a substantial burden on hardware and software implementations, hindering device portability and efficient deployment 1.The Tensor Operator Set Architecture (TOSA) has emerged as a pivotal solution to address these challenges. It provides a minimal yet stable set of tensor-level operators 1 that act as a common intermediate representation to which operators from various machine learning frameworks can be reduced 1. The primary goal of TOSA is to enable a variety of implementations that can run seamlessly on a diverse range of processors, including ARM's SIMD CPUs, Mali GPUs, and specialized neural processing units (NPUs) like the Ethos-U family, while ensuring consistent results at the TOSA level 3.At its core, TOSA defines a comprehensive set of whole-tensor operations 3, B_B1] that are fundamental to deep neural networks. These operations are not further decomposed within the TOSA specification, allowing for flexibility in how they are implemented on different hardware 1. The TOSA operator set is meticulously categorized to cover a broad spectrum of functionalities essential for modern neural networks. These categories include tensor operators for core computations like convolution (CONV2D), matrix multiplication (MATMUL), and pooling (AVG_POOL2D, MAX_POOL2D); activation functions such as SIGMOID and TANH; elementwise binary operators like ADD and MUL, as well as unary operators like ABS and NEGATE; reduction operators such as REDUCE_SUM and REDUCE_MAX; operators for manipulating data layout like RESHAPE and TRANSPOSE; scatter/gather operations (GATHER, SCATTER); image-specific operators like RESIZE; type conversion operators (CAST, RESCALE); data nodes for representing constants (CONST) and identity operations (IDENTITY); custom operators for extensibility (CUSTOM); control flow operators for conditional execution (COND_IF) and loops (WHILE_LOOP); variable operators for handling stateful computations (VARIABLE, VARIABLE_WRITE, VARIABLE_READ); and shape operators (CONST_SHAPE).Crucially, TOSA offers full support for both quantized integer and floating-point content 3, B_B12. This dual support is vital for the ARM ecosystem, which spans from high-performance server processors to deeply embedded microcontrollers. Quantized models, in particular, are often preferred for deployment on resource-constrained ARM devices due to their reduced memory footprint and faster inference speeds 2. TOSA incorporates precision details directly into its operator definitions, effectively combining quantization information with the functional behavior of each operation 5.Every operator within the TOSA specification is accompanied by a precise functional and numerical description 1. These descriptions meticulously detail the expected behavior of each operator, including the handling of numerical aspects such as precision, saturation, and scaling, especially for quantized datatypes 3. This level of detail ensures that developers can rely on consistent and predictable behavior across different hardware implementations, which is paramount for achieving model accuracy and reliability on diverse ARM platforms.A fundamental design principle of TOSA is its agnosticism towards any single high-level framework, compiler backend stack, or particular target hardware 1. This independence allows machine learning frameworks to lower their respective operators into the standardized TOSA representation. Once in TOSA format, models can be processed by various compiler backends and ultimately executed on a wide range of ARM processors and accelerators without being tied to the specifics of the original framework or the final hardware target.The TOSA specification itself undergoes a structured development process, employing a versioning scheme similar to software releases, with major, minor, and patch versions 3. This approach ensures a balance between stability and evolution, where major releases might introduce breaking changes, minor releases typically add new features in a backward-compatible manner, and patch releases focus on addressing bugs and providing clarifications 3.The adoption of TOSA within the ARM ecosystem yields several significant benefits. Portability is greatly enhanced as applications and frameworks targeting TOSA can be deployed across a vast array of ARM processors, from the energy-efficient Cortex-M series to the high-performance Cortex-A series, as well as specialized NPUs like the Ethos-U family 3. This broad portability reduces the development effort required to target different ARM devices. Efficiency is another key advantage, as TOSA's focus on essential tensor operations and its inherent support for quantization enable the development of highly optimized implementations on ARM hardware 5. This leads to improved performance, lower latency, and reduced power consumption, which are particularly crucial for edge and embedded AI applications. Furthermore, TOSA offers a degree of future-proofing 1. As machine learning continues to evolve with new models and operators, if these can be effectively represented using the existing TOSA primitives, they can potentially run on TOSA-compliant ARM hardware already in deployment. Finally, TOSA's status as an open standard 2 with a permissive license 4 fosters community collaboration and innovation, benefiting the entire ARM machine learning ecosystem.Integration with Deep Learning Frameworks on ARMThe utility of TOSA is significantly amplified through its integration with popular deep learning frameworks when targeting ARM platforms.PyTorch Integration: Arm has actively collaborated with Meta to provide strong support for ARM within ExecuTorch 8, an end-to-end solution designed to streamline the deployment of PyTorch-developed AI models on ARM-powered edge devices 8. This collaboration simplifies the often complex process of moving models from the flexible PyTorch environment to the resource-constrained edge. The typical workflow involves converting a trained PyTorch model into a quantized TOSA representation 8 using PyTorch's dynamo export flow. This intermediate TOSA graph is then fed into the ARM Ethos-U compiler, Vela, which has been specifically enhanced with a TOSA front-end 8 to understand and process TOSA. Vela then generates the highly optimized machine instructions (command stream) necessary for efficient execution on the Ethos-U family of NPUs, including the U55, U65, and the high-performance U85 8. The ExecuTorch tutorial demonstrates this process using scripts like aot_arm_compiler.py to export PyTorch models (e.g., SoftmaxModule, AddModule, MobileNetV2) into .pte files, which can be simulated on the Corstone-300 FVP. While specific examples for RNNs and Transformers are not extensively detailed, the general workflow is applicable provided the operators are supported by the Ethos-U backend.TensorFlow Integration: TensorFlow Lite is a widely adopted framework for deploying machine learning models on edge devices, including ARM-based systems 1. TOSA is intended to be a key target for lowering operators from both TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite 1, facilitating efficient execution on ARM hardware. The Arm NN SDK is a crucial component in this integration, enabling the execution of TensorFlow Lite models on ARM CPUs and Mali GPUs 18, B_B3]. Arm NN includes a TOSA reference implementation (TosaRef) and supports the mapping of various TensorFlow Lite operators to TOSA operations 18, B_B3], suggesting an internal utilization of TOSA for optimization. To help developers ensure the portability of their TensorFlow Lite models, the tosa-checker tool is available 1, allowing them to verify the compatibility of their models with the TOSA specification.ONNX Integration: ONNX Runtime, a high-performance inference engine for ONNX models, provides an Arm NN Execution Provider 27, B_B4]. This allows ONNX Runtime to leverage the Arm NN SDK for accelerating ONNX models on ARM devices 27. While the direct execution flow might use Arm NN's internal optimizations, there is potential for ONNX models to be converted to TOSA, especially when targeting ARM NPUs like the Ethos-U series 1. The MLIR compiler infrastructure is actively being used to develop legalization passes that can translate ONNX graphs into TOSA 1. The ONNX Runtime documentation provides C/C++ examples for registering the Arm NN execution provider 35, B_B4].TOSA and Neural Network Architectures on ARMTOSA's design and the supporting software ecosystem enable the efficient deployment of various neural network architectures on ARM platforms.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs, essential for image processing, are well-supported on ARM. Models like MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 can be deployed using TensorFlow Lite with the Arm NN SDK 28, B_B13] and PyTorch with ExecuTorch and Vela. These frameworks abstract away the complexities of hardware interaction, potentially using TOSA internally for optimization. The ExecuTorch tutorial and the Arm NN SDK documentation 28, B_B13] provide conceptual examples and steps for deploying CNNs on ARM.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): The TOSA specification includes operators necessary for representing RNNs, including control flow operators like WHILE_LOOP 4, B_B1]. While end-to-end deployment examples specifically using TOSA followed by Vela compilation might be less common in the provided snippets, frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers demonstrate the deployment of RNNs on ARM Cortex-M devices 20, indicating underlying support that could align with TOSA principles.Transformer Networks: The ARM Ethos-U85 NPU stands out with its native support for transformer-based models through its optimized TOSA implementation 7. This makes it highly suitable for running large language models and other advanced AI workloads at the edge. PyTorch-based Transformer models can be deployed to Ethos-U85 using ExecuTorch, which converts them to TOSA 8. ONNX models might leverage ONNX Runtime and Arm NN, with potential future pathways involving TOSA conversion via MLIR 1.TOSA as a Research Topic and its Current ApplicationsTOSA remains an active area of research and development, particularly within the domain of edge AI 1. Ongoing research focuses on expanding the operator set and enhancing the efficiency of implementations on diverse ARM hardware 1. The ML Platform actively hosts discussions and welcomes contributions to the TOSA specification and its reference implementation 2, fostering a collaborative research environment.The ARM Ethos-U85's native support for TOSA is a significant development for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) at the edge 8. Optimization techniques like quantization are crucial for running these demanding models efficiently on ARM 11. Projects like ExecuTorch facilitate the deployment of PyTorch-based LLMs on ARM using TOSA 8. While dedicated research papers on "TOSA ARM large language models" are limited in the provided snippets, the general trend of deploying LLMs on ARM using TOSA-enabled hardware is evident 16.Regarding Large Image Diffusion Models, the provided material does not contain explicit research focusing on "TOSA ARM diffusion models".
